<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the user’s guide to Kibella. Kibella is part of the “TIM<b>i </b>Suite<b>” </b>that is an
	integrated set of tools designed to solve Business Intelligence problems. The acronym “TIMi” stands for
	“<b>T</b>he <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>M</b>ining Mach<b>i</b>ne (TIM<b>i </b>)” .</p>
<p>Kibella is a “dashboarding tool" or “Dataviz tool” similar to Tableau, Qlickview, Kibana, Kyubit, etc. Basically, a
	“Dataviz tool” allows you to see different kind of visualizations (bart chart, pie chart, etc.) inside a web
	browser.</p>
<p>More precisely, Kibella allows you to create and deploy everywhere interactive dashboards (with full <nobr>
		“drill-down”</nobr> functionality) in a few <nobr>mouse-clicks.</nobr> Kibella is closely integrated with
	Anatella so that all data available inside Anatella can easily be exported to Kibella to create beautiful
	visualizations and dashboards.</p>
<p>Kibella is related to Kibana (from which it shares a part of the source code). …but Kibella adds many interesting
	features <nobr>“on-top”</nobr> of Kibana:</p>
<ul>

	<li>
		<p><b>No complex infrastructure required</b></p>
		<p>Kibella works inside a simple <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)"><b>LAMP</b></a>/<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)#WAMP"><b>WAMP</b></a> stack. In
			opposition, Kibana can only be deployed inside a complex <nobr>hadoop-based</nobr> infrastructure that
			typically implies many nodes (for distributed computations) and specific, <nobr>non-standard,</nobr>
			webservers (i.e. node.js).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>Simpler to administrate</b></p>
		<p>Kibella is built using a set of technology that is mastered by 100% of all technicians (i.e.
			Apache+Php+SQLite). In opposition, Kibana requires you to administrate “shards” (i.e. nodes with a specific
			elasticsearch stack installed on them) and to administrate “node.js”.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>Fast at <nobr>Query-Time</nobr></b> (the SQLite engine used by Kibella is based on efficient C++ code).</p>
		<p>A very small server can handle a very large quantity of data. The SQLite engine used inside Kibella is using
			large <nobr>in-memory</nobr>
			<nobr>data-cache,</nobr> so that it can use all your RAM, if available. …but the SQLite engine from Kibella
			is not limited by the RAM of your PC (in opposition to Qlickview or Kibana): You can handle <nobr>
				larger-than-RAM</nobr> databases very fast &amp; very easily.
		</p>
		<p><i><b>Note: </b>We are still working on improving Kibella’s speed. The final version of Kibella should
			display dashboards in a time divided by 5 compared to the <nobr>Early-Access</nobr> version of Kibella.</i></p>
		<p>In opposition, the computing power delivered by Kibana on one server is much lower. Of course, you can
			install Kibana on many “shards/nodes” to still reach a large computing power.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>Scalable</b></p>
		<p>It’s very unlikely that you ever need to take care about “scalability issues” when working with</p>
		<p>Kibella (e.g. because, in opposition to other solutions, you are not limited by the RAM of your server).
			However, if you are experiencing some “slow down” when “drilling down” inside a dashboard, you can still use
			Anatella to reduce the size of your datasets before exporting them to Kibella. To reduce your dataset size,
			you can use the many standard data transformations available inside Anatella (i.e. mainly the “aggregation” box). With Anatella, you can easily handles
			databases containing several dozens of Terabytes on a “common grade” laptop.</p>
		<p>The combination of Kibella and Anatella allows to cope with any situation, whatever the size, the complexity,
			the origin, the velocity or the format of the data.</p>
		<p>Kibana typically scales in a different way: You’ll typically add additional computing nodes (named “shards”
			in the elastic world) to “scale up”. In comparison to Kibella, Kibana has a more expansive “scaling up”
			(because all these additional nodes involves additional costs in hardware and additional costs in salary for
			maintenance &amp; support of this exotic components).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>Fast at <nobr>load-time</nobr></b></p>
		<p>Kibella has no load time: To update the data “behind” your dashboards, you just use Anatella to create/update your SQlite database files: This is usually done in a few seconds.</p>
		<p>In opposition, with Kibana, updating the data “behind” your dashboards is a long procedure because Kibana
			takes a huge amount of time to <nobr>re-start</nobr> (after the JSON dataset files have been updated):
			Sometime several hours (because it has to parse the complex JSON files to re- create many complex indexes).
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>Integration with Anatella</b></p>
		<p>This is not really a difference because both Kibella and Kibana are 100% integrated with Anatella: To export
			you data to Kibella or Kibana (or Tableau or Qlickview), you’ll use:</p>
		
		<p>It should be noted that, <nobr>up-to-now,</nobr> there exists no other ETL tool that is able to create the
			complex JSON files used by Kibana: i.e. To use Kibana, you must provide all the data to query within a
			single, large &amp; complex JSON file. This JSON file has a rather twisted structure (i.e. it has a <nobr>
				multi-level</nobr> structure). There is inside Anatella a small box (the “writeJSON” box) that is exactly designed to generate these <nobr>"multi-level"</nobr> JSON files. You'll find more details about the
			integration between Anatella and Kibana in the section 4.8.17.13. of the "AnatellaQuickGuide.pdf".</p>
			<div class="quote"><p><b>An example</b>: The data scientists from AXA Belgium (i.e. the guys from the AXA "Datalab") are using extensively
			the "writeJSON" box from Anatella to create various dashboards in Kibana (they have more than ten Kibana
			running all the time). In one of their dashboard, they generate a very complex 40 GB JSON file (4 levels
			deep) in less than 15 minutes with Anatella (in comparison, the other data scientists attempted to replicate
			the same performances in Hadoop and they had no results after 24 hours of computation). You'll find more
			details about the integration between Anatella and Kibana in the section 4.8.17.13. of the
			"AnatellaQuickGuide.pdf".</p></div>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why did we create Kibella ?</h2>
<p>We loved Kibana but we recognized that not all companies are willing to invest time and
	efforts in an exotic technology such as the one used inside Kibana. Basically, most companies have a quite limited
	volume of data to visualize (we noticed that, after proceeding with the required aggregations with Anatella, 99% of
	the companies have a data volume that is less than 1GB for visualization). Thus, for 99% of the companies (i.e. for
	the companies that have “normal” dashboarding needs), using a complex distributed computing system for visualization
	(such as Kibana) does not make any sense: it’s much easier &amp; cheaper to use Kibella.</p>
<div class="quote">
	<p><b>Question:</b> Do I need distributed computations (such as the one included inside Kibana) to create my
		dashboards?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="quote">
	<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
	<p>Let’s take a first <nobr>real-life</nobr> example: We are currently working extensively with many telecoms all around
		the world. We provide them with advanced analytics (e.g. churn &amp; <nobr>cross-sell</nobr> models) and “basic”
		reporting/dashboarding. We noticed that, for a small telecom with around 20 million subscribers, each dashboard in
		production is actually only using around 10 MB of data that is stored “on the visualization webserver” (after some
		data aggregations with Anatella. …but these aggregations are nevertheless always required, whatever the “dataviz
		tool” used, because of the large size of the “source” data). In this case, you don’t need Kibana.</p>
	<p>Another <nobr>real-life</nobr> example: The “DataLab” from AXA makes a <nobr>non-traditional</nobr>
	</p>
	<p>usage of Kibana: They use it as a CRM tool (and not really as a Dashboarding tool). It means that they inject inside
		Kibana (i.e. inside ElasticSearch engine) their whole CRM database (that contains a table with their “360° Customer
		view”: This table has more than 1000 columns). To obtain an interactive, sub- second, <nobr>drill-down</nobr> on
		this large table, you need Kibana (more precisely, you need the ElasticSearch engine).</p>

<h2>The advantages of Kibella over other tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
<p>
	<b><nobr>Self-service</nobr> BI</b>
</p>
<p>Anybody can create beautiful dashboards in a few <nobr>mouse-click</nobr> without writing any line of code.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Free &amp; Unrestricted:</b></p>
<p>No limits on the numbers of viewers and designers.</p>
<div class="quote"><p>In particular, Tableau and Qlickview are limited in this regard because each additional person that simply “view”
	your dashboard costs you a thousand euro more. At this price, you’d better think twice before sharing anything with
	a new colleague!</p></div></li>
<li><p>
	<nobr><b>In-Browser-Designer:</b></nobr>
</p>
<p>No need to install anything on the designer computer: The designer runs inside a browser. Anybody can become a
	“designer” and improve your dashboard design. This allows easy collaborative work.</p>

<div class="quote"><p>In particular, Tableau and Qlickview are limited in this regard because each additional “designer” costs you a few
	thousand euro more. At this prices, you’d better think twice before collaborating on a dashboard with a new
	colleague!</p></div></li>
<li><p><b>Ethical solution:</b></p>
<p>The data format used by Kibella to store all the data for visualization is the simple and ubiquitous “SQLite” file
	format. The SQlite file format is readable &amp; writable by 99% of the <nobr>data-management</nobr> tools currently
	available on the market. This means that you’ll always be able to retrieve the data stored inside Kibella for
	further processing (e.g. for further processing inside a predictive modeling tool such as TIMi Modeler).</p>
<div class="quote"><p>In opposition to Kibella, Tableau and Qlickview are storing their data in a proprietary file format (TDE files for
	Tableau and QVX/QVB files for Qlikview) that no software (outside Tableau and Qlikview) can read (although Anatella
	can create these files, it cannot read them back).</p>
<p>This means that, if you saw something interesting inside one of your dashboards and you want to investigate the
	matter in more details (e.g. using a predictive modeling tool such as TIMi Modeler), you simply cannot use the TDE
	or the QVB files to start your investigation.</p>
<p>If you are lucky and you IT service kept a copy of the original data before exporting everything to Tableau or
	Qlickview, you can still work.</p>
<p>…But, 99% of the time, this won’t be the case. Most of the time, you won’t be able to get access to your data anymore
	(only through a very limited aggregated view inside your browser, that is totally insufficient for any predictive
	modeling activities). This is a <nobr>“lock-in”</nobr> situation: i.e. You are now forced to use Tableau/Qlickview
	to make any data analysis (even if Tableau or Qlickview are not adapted to the nature of the investigation that you
	want to perform). This is why Tableau ang Qlikview are strictly forbidding anybody to create a data extraction tool
	from the proprietary format: They want a <nobr>“lock-in”</nobr> situation.</p>
<p>Thanks to the open nature of Kibella (and within all the tools included in the TIMi Suite), you can have the 100%
	guarantee that we will never “take hostage” your data: You are safe with us. The only <nobr>“lock-in”</nobr>
	situation that we pursue is the one of Excellence: i.e. you are working with TIMi because that’s technically the
	better solution.</p>
<p>This is why we declare ourselves as an “Ethical Solution”: No <nobr>“lock-in”</nobr> situation, just Excellence.</p></div></li>
<li><p><b>Cheap and Ubiquitous deployment:</b></p>
<p>Kibella runs on any common LAMP stack (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP) available in any datacenters. The LAMP stack is the
	most commonly used solution and the cheapest solution used to create Webservers.</p>
<p>To still reduce costs, the same LAMP server can hosts several copies of Kibella (each copy is 100% isolated from the
	others). This allows to have one separated Kibella for each department inside your company at no additional cost
	(i.e. one kibella for accounting, one kibella for marketing, one kibella for engineering, etc.).</p></li>

<li>
	<p>
	<b>Fast at <nobr>Query-Time</nobr></b>(the SQLite engine used by Kibella is based on efficient C++ code).
</p>
<p>A very small server can handle a very large quantity of data. You can handle <nobr>larger-than-RAM</nobr> databases
	very fast &amp; easily.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>We are still working on improving Kibella’s speed. The final version of Kibella should display
	dashboards in a time divided by 5 compared to the <nobr>Early-Access</nobr> version of Kibella.</p>
<div class="quote"><p>In any dashboarding solution, the bottleneck (that slows down everything) is always the webserver: i.e. The resources
	of the Webserver are limited and shared between all the “viewers” of the dashboards.</p>
<p>Thus, you need to have as much code running on the browser as possible (to have the smallest computing load on the
	webserver as possible). This is how Kibella is built and that’s great.</p>
<p>…But Kibana is following another direction: The “ElasticSearch” company (that is developing Kibana) wants to promote
	their main product (that is “ElasticSearch”). To that end, they need to make sure that Kibana is as
	<b>in</b>compatible as possible with "classic &amp; standard technologies" (such as an “Apache” server). This
	is why the “ElasticSearch” company restructured the code of the newest version of Kibana to have the largest part of
	the code as possible running on the webserver, inside “Node.js” (since the “Apache” webserver cannot run any
	Javascript code, this ensures that the newest releases of Kibana are <b>in</b>compatible with “Apache”). This
	is not a very good technical decision (although it makes sense commercially!).</p></div></li>
<li><p><b>Fast at <nobr>load-time.</nobr></b>
	
</p>
<p>With all other solutions, updating the data “behind” your dashboards is a long procedure</p>
<p>(involving painful &amp; slow data extractions).</p>
<p>Especially, the “normal” Kibana takes a huge amount of time to <nobr>start-up.</nobr>
</p>
<p>In opposition, updating the datasets displayed by Kibella is very fast &amp; easy: Just use the new</p>
<p>Anatella action named: “ExportToKibella”: it’s available here:</p>
<p>Usually, the speed of the “ExportToKibella” Action is only limited by the speed of your hard drive. This means that,
	99% of the time, you can update the data “behind” your dashboards in a few seconds.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Incremental Loads:</b></p>
<p>The “ExportToKibella” Action supports a wide variety of “updates” mechanism. e.g. You can <nobr>near-instantaneously
	</nobr> add rows to (and/or delete rows from) an existing dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>
	<nobr><b>Real-time</b></nobr> display
</p>
<p>You can see inside your dashboard the latest data that just arrived (e.g. from the last 5 seconds). This
	functionality combined with the “Incremental Loads” allows you to obtain dashboards that update in <nobr>
		“real-time”,</nobr> closely following the process that you are monitoring.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Easy deployment from lab to production:</b></p>
<p>When you finished developing some new dashboards locally (i.e. without any internet connection required), you can
	export your work to the production server by a simple drag&amp;drop (i.e. just copy the “kibella.sqlite” file to the
	production server: This file contains all the visualizations and all the dashboards).</p></li>
<li><p><b>100% compatibility between the Windows &amp; Linux executables:</b></p>
<p>You can design on Windows (locally) and publish on Linux everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Based on a 100% secure technology: i.e. the “Apache Web Server”.</b></p>
<p>The “Apache Web Server” is the most common and the most trusted webserver currently available: Here are some <nobr>
		market-share</nobr> statistics:</p>

<p>Thanks to Apache, Kibella is 100% secure: i.e. you can deploy all your dashboards to a wide audience without any fear
	of any “Russian Web Hackers”.</p>
<p>All other dashboarding/BI solutions (Tableau, Qlickview, Kibana, Microsoft PowerBI,etc.) must be used exclusively on
	a private network, heavily secured (because these solutions are not robust against “Russian Web Hackers”).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Large choice of Security options:</b></p>
<p>The “Apache Web Server” contains a large quantity of options to authenticate the Kibella dashboards users. You can
	manage users:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
<p><nobr>“One-by-one”</nobr> or at the “group level”</p></li>
<li><p>Through standard LDAP protocol
</p></li>

<p><b>Kibella is the only solution that allows you to distribute your dashboards to an unlimited audience (no
		financial limits, no barriers linked to the security of the server, very cheap infrastructure, instantaneous
		sharing).</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Somewhat Beautiful</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <nobr>dis-advantages</nobr> of Kibella are:</p>
<p><b>On very, very large datasets, it’s sometime better, to obtain a more reactive dashboard, to reduce the size of
		your dataset before exporting it to Kibella. To reduce your dataset size, you can use the many standard data
		transformations (i.e. mainly the “aggregation” box) available inside Anatella. Another solution is to use some
		distributed computations in Kibana.</b></p>
<p><b>No so beautiful compared to Tableau (but Kibella will evolve rapidly!)</b></p>
<p>We really think that the combination of Kibella with Anatella is just incredible. Anatella offer so much computing
	power and flexibility while Kibella allows you to share your results instantaneously to anybody, without any
	financial limits nor infrastructure limits.</p>

<h1>Importing Tables inside Kibella</h1>
<h2>Importing Tables inside Kibella using Anatella</h2>
<p>
	Just use the Action “ExportToKibella” and check the option “Directly Publish
	new Data Base to (This option is anyway checked by default)
</p>
<h2>Importing Tables inside Kibella using another ETL</h2>
<p>
	Create a new SQLite database inside the “Kibella datadir” (the exact location
	of the “Kibella datadir” is defined inside the “Kibella.ini” file). Then, open
	a browser and go to the Kibella webpage
	<a href="http://localhost/kibella/">(<b>http://localhost/kibella/</b>)
		</a>and click on the “<b>Register a table to query on</b>” link:
</p>
<p>
	A registered table is identified by its ID which is made up of the
	<b>table name followed by the database filename in parenthesis</b>. Ex:
	Census(CENSUSINCOME).
</p>

<h2>Storing Dates and the “Date Format” inside the queried databases</h2>
<p>
	All the columns containing dates (or any <nobr>time-related</nobr> value) must
	be listed here during exportation to Kibella:
</p>
<p>
	The “date” columns must contains dates using a specific format: The format to
	use is the “Elapsed Time” format: More Precisely: You can convert any <nobr>date-format</nobr> to
	the right format for Kibella using the “ChangeDataType” box inside Anatella: i.e. Use these parameters:</p>
<p>1: Select all the columns containing dates</p>
<p>2: Write the current format of the dates here</p>
<p>3: Leave this blank</p>
<p>4: switch to “second”</p>
<p>
	(For Kibella, the Dates in the queried tables are stored as
	<b>seconds </b>elapsed since 1970/01/01 00:00:00).
</p>
<h1>Using Kibella</h1>
<h2>Creating new Visualizations</h2>
<h3>The New Visualization Wizard</h3>
<p>You can use the Visualize tab to design data visualizations. You can save these visualizations, use them
	individually, or combine visualizations into a dashboard.</p>
<p>To start the <b>New Visualization </b>wizard, click on the Visualize tab at the top left of the page.</p>
<p>If you are already in the process of creating a visualization, you can click the New Visualization button New
	Visualization </b>wizard again.</p>
<p>The wizard guides you through the following steps:</p>
<h4>Step 1: Choose the Visualization Type</h4>
<p>Choose a visualization type when you start the New Visualization wizard:</p>
<p>You can also load a save visualization that you created earlier. The saved visualization selector includes a text
	field to filter by visualization name and a link to the Object Editor, accessible through <b>Settings &gt; Edit
		Saved Objects</b>, to manage your saved visualizations.</p>


<p>If your new visualization is a Markdown widget, selecting that type takes you to a text entry field where you
	enter the text to display in the widget. For all other types of visualization, selecting the type takes you to
	data source selection.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Choose a Data Source</h4>
<p>You can choose a new or saved search to serve as the data source for your visualization. Searches are associated
	with an index or a set of indexes. When you select new search on a system with multiple indices configured,
	select an index pattern from the <nobr>drop-down</nobr> to bring up the visualization editor.</p>
<p>When you create a visualization from a saved search and save the visualization, the search is tied to the
	visualization. When you make changes to the search that is linked to the visualization, the visualization
	updates automatically.</p>
<h4>Step 3: The Visualization Editor</h4>
<p>The visualization editor enables you to configure and edit visualizations. The visualization editor has the
	following main elements:</p>

<h5>The Toolbar</h5>
<p>The toolbar has a search field for interactive data searches, as well as controls to manage saving and loading
	visualizations. For visualizations based on saved searches, the search bar is grayed out. To edit the search,
	replacing the saved search with the edited version, <nobr>double-click</nobr> the search field.</p>


<p>The toolbar at the right of the search box has buttons for creating new visualizations, saving the current
	visualization, loading an existing visualization, sharing or embedding the visualization, and refreshing the
	data for the current visualization.</p>
<h5>The aggregation builder</h5>
<p>Use the aggregation builder on the left of the page to configure the metric and bucket aggregations used in your
	visualization. Buckets are analogous to SQL GROUP BY statements.</p>
<p>Bar, line, or area chart visualizations use <b>metrics </b>for the <nobr>y-axis</nobr> and <b>buckets
	</b>are used for the <nobr>x-axis,</nobr> segment bar colors, and row/column splits. For pie charts, use the
	metric for the slice size and the bucket for the number of slices.</p>
<p>Choose the metric aggregation for your visualization’s Y axis, such as count, average, sum, min, max, or
	cardinality (unique count). Use bucket aggregations for the visualization’s X axis, color slices, and row/column
	splits. Common bucket aggregations include date histogram, range, terms, filters, and significant terms.</p>
<h5>Preview</h5>
<p>The preview canvas displays a preview of the visualization you’ve defined in the aggregation builder.</p>
<p>To refresh the visualization preview, clicking the Refresh button on the toolbar.</p>
<h2>Area Chart Visualization</h2>
<p>This chart’s Y axis is the <b>metrics </b>axis. The following aggregations are available for this axis:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Count:</b> The count aggregation returns a raw count of the elements in the selected index
		pattern.</li>
	<li><b>Average:</b> This aggregation returns the average of a numeric field. Select a field from the
		drop- down.</li>
	<li><b>Sum:</b> The sum aggregation returns the total sum of a numeric field. Select a field from the
		<nobr>drop-down.</nobr>
	</li>
	<li><b>Min:</b> The min aggregation returns the minimum value of a numeric field. Select a field from
		the <nobr>drop-down.</nobr>
	</li>
	<li><b>Max:</b> The max aggregation returns the maximum value of a numeric field. Select a field from
		the <nobr>drop-down.</nobr>
	</li>
	<li><b>Unique Count:</b> The cardinality aggregation returns the number of unique values in a field.
		Select a field from the <nobr>drop-down.</nobr>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add an aggregation by clicking the <b>+ Add Aggregation </b>button.</p>
<p>The X axis of this chart is the buckets axis. You can define buckets for the X axis, for a split area on the chart,
	or for split charts.</p>

<p>This chart’s X axis supports the following aggregations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>Date Histogram</b></p>

	</p>
	<h2>Tile Maps Visualization</h2>
	<p>A tile map displays a geographic area overlaid with circles keyed to the data determined by the buckets you
		specify.</p>
	<p>The default metrics aggregation for a tile map is the Count aggregation. You can select any of the following
		aggregations as the metrics aggregation:</p>
	<p><b>Count:</b> The count aggregation returns a raw count of the elements in the selected index pattern.</p>
	<p><b>Average:</b> This aggregation returns the average of a numeric field. Select a field from the drop-
		down.</p>
	<p><b>Sum:</b> The sum aggregation returns the total sum of a numeric field. Select a field from the <nobr>
			drop-down.</nobr>
	</p>
	<p><b>Min:</b> The min aggregation returns the minimum value of a numeric field. Select a field from the
		<nobr>drop-down.</nobr>
	</p>
	<p><b>Max:</b> The max aggregation returns the maximum value of a numeric field. Select a field from the
		<nobr>drop-down.</nobr>
	</p>
	<p><b>Unique Count:</b> The cardinality aggregation returns the number of unique values in a field. Select a
		field from the <nobr>drop-down.</nobr>
	</p>
	<p>The buckets aggregations determine what information is being retrieved from your data set.</p>
	<p>Before you choose a buckets aggregation, specify if you are splitting the chart or displaying the buckets as
		<b>Geo Coordinates </b>on a single chart. A multiple chart split must run before any other aggregations.
	</p>
	<p>Tile maps use the <b>Geohash </b>aggregation as their initial aggregation. Select a field, typically
		coordinates, from the <nobr>drop-down.</nobr> The <b>Precision </b>slider determines the granularity of
		the results displayed on the map.</p>
	<p>Once you’ve specified a buckets aggregation, you can define <nobr>sub-aggregations</nobr> to refine the
		visualization. Tile maps only support <nobr>sub-aggregations</nobr> as split charts. Click <b>+ Add Sub
			Aggregation</b>, then <b>Split Chart </b>to select a <nobr>sub-aggregation</nobr> from the list of
		types:</p>
	<p><b>Date Histogram</b></p>

	<h2>Dashboards</h2>
	<p>A Kibella dashboard displays a set of saved visualizations in groups that you can arrange freely. You can save a
		dashboard to share or reload at a later time.</p>
	<p>Here is a sample dashboard:</p>
	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
	<p>You need at least one saved visualization to use a dashboard.</p>
	<h4>Building a New Dashboard</h4>
	<p>The first time you click the Dashboard tab, Kibella displays an empty dashboard:</p>
	<p>Build your dashboard by adding visualizations.</p>

	<h4>Adding Visualizations to a Dashboard</h4>
	<p>To add a visualization to the dashboard, click the <b>Add Visualization </b>Visualization Filter
		</b>field.</p>
	<p>The visualization you select appears in a <b>container </b>on your dashboard.</p>
	<h4>Saving Dashboards</h4>
	<p>To save the dashboard, click the Save Dashboard button in the toolbar panel, enter a name for the dashboard in
		the Save As field, and click the Save button. By default, dashboards store the time period specified in the time
		filter when you save a dashboard. To disable this behavior, clear the Store time with dashboard box before
		clicking the Save button.</p>
	<h4>Loading a Saved Dashboard</h4>
	<p>Click the Load Saved Dashboard button to display a list of existing dashboards. The saved dashboard selector
		includes a text field to filter by dashboard name and a link to the Object Editor for managing your saved
		dashboards. You can also access the Object Editor by clicking Settings &gt; Edit Saved Objects.</p>
	<h4>Sharing Dashboards</h4>
	<p>You can share dashboards with other users. You can share a direct link to the Kibella dashboard or embed the
		dashboard in your Web page.</p>
	<p>Click the <b>Share </b>button to display HTML code to embed the dashboard in another Web page, along with a

		mouse button to confirm the new container size.</p>
	<h4>Editing the Visualization inside a Container</h4>
	<p>Click the Edit button at the top right of a container to open the visualization in the Visualize page.</p>
	<h4>Removing Containers</h4>
	<p>Click the x icon at the top right corner of a container to remove that container from the dashboard. Removing a
		container from a dashboard does not delete the saved visualization in that container.</p>
	<h4>The raw data behind the visualization</h4>
	<p>To display the raw data behind the visualization, click the bar at the bottom of the container. Tabs with
		detailed information about the raw data replace the visualization:</p>
	<p><b>Table.</b> A representation of the underlying data, presented as a paginated data grid. You can sort the
		items in the table by clicking on the table headers at the top of each column.</p>
	<p><b>Request.</b> The raw request used to query the server, presented in JSON format.</p>
	<p><b>Response.</b> The raw response from the server, presented in JSON format.</p>
	<p><b>Statistics.</b> A summary of the statistics related to the request and the response, presented as a data
		grid. The data grid includes the query duration, the request duration, the total number of records found on the
		server, and the index pattern used to make the query.</p>
	<p><b>(at the bottom of any of the detailed information tabs) Raw or Formatted links</b><b>: Export the raw
			data behind the visualization as a </b>
		<nobr><b>comma-separated-values</b></nobr><b> (CSV) file. A raw export contains the data as it is
			stored in Kibella. A formatted export contains the results of any applicable Kibella field
			formatters.</b>
	</p>
	<h3>Working with Filters</h3>
	<h4>Simple Filters</h4>
	<p>When you create a filter anywhere in Kibella, the filter conditions display in a green oval under the search text
		entry box:</p>
	<p>Hovering on the filter oval displays the following icons:</p>
	<p>Here is a description of each icon:</p>
	<p><b>Enable Filter </b></p>
	<p>Click this icon to disable the filter without removing it. You can enable the filter again later by clicking the
		icon again. Disabled filters display a striped shaded color, green for inclusion filters and red for exclusion
		filters.</p>
	<p><b>Pin Filter </b></p>
	<p>Click this icon to pin a filter. Pinned filters persist across Kibella tabs. You can pin filters from the
		Dashboard tab, click on the Visualize tab, and those filters remain in place.</p>
	<p><b>Note</b><b>:</b> If you have a pinned filter and you’re not seeing any query results, that your
		current tab’s index pattern is one that the filter applies to.</p>
	<p><b>Toggle Filter </b></p>
	<p>Click this icon to toggle a filter. By default, filters are inclusion filters, and display in green. Only
		elements that match the filter are displayed. To change this to an exclusion filters, displaying only elements
		that don’t match, toggle the filter. Exclusion filters display in red.</p>
	<p><b>Remove Filter </b></p>
	<p>Click this icon to remove a filter entirely.</p>
	<p><b>Custom Filter </b></p>
	<p>Click this icon to display a text field where you can customize the JSON representation of the filter. Click the
		Done button to update the filter with your changes.</p>
	<p>To apply any of the filter actions to all the filters currently in place, click the Global Filter Actions button
		and select an action.</p>
	<h4>Filters on dates</h4>
	<p>Date Filters Inside the Visualization Panel:</p>
	<p>Inside the Visualization Panel, the calendar interface is not available. The only way to filter dates is by using
		the free box for normal filters at the top and filtering the date using ranges defined on seconds elapsed since
		1970/01/01 00:00:00. An example of such a filter is:</p>
	<p>1430611200 &lt;= date and date &lt;= 1462406400</p>
	<p><b>…which filters the date variable </b>date <b>between </b>
		<nobr>'03-May-2015</nobr> 02:00:00' <b>and </b>
		<nobr>'05-May-</nobr> 2016 02:00:00'<b>.</b>
	</p>
	<p>Inside the Dashboard Panel, the calendar interface is available to easily create different queries on dates:
		Click here:</p>
	<p>Inside the <nobr>Early-Access</nobr> version of Kibella, relative date values like <nobr>“now-1w/w”</nobr> (which
		appears as default in Kibella) are currently not supported.</p>

	<h3>Automatic Refresh of the Page</h3>
	<p>You can configure a refresh interval to automatically refresh the page with the latest index data. This
		periodically resubmits the search query.</p>
	<p>When a refresh interval is set, it is displayed to the left of the Time Filter in the menu bar.</p>
	<p>To set the refresh interval:</p>
	<p><b>1.</b><b>Click the </b><b>Time Filter </b> in the upper right corner of the menu bar:</p>
	<p><b>2.</b><b>Click the </b>Refresh Interval <b>tab.</b></p>
	<p><b>3.</b><b>Choose a refresh interval from the list.</b></p>
	<p>To automatically refresh the data, click the </b>button and select an autorefresh interval:</p>
	<p>When <nobr>auto-refresh</nobr> is enabled, Kibella’s top bar displays a pause button and the <nobr>auto-refresh
		</nobr> interval: Pause </b>button to pause <nobr>auto-refresh.</nobr>
